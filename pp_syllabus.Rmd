# Objectives and Assignments

This course explores "peer production" which is a name for the open collaborations that produce things like open source software and Wikipedia.  Perhaps not coincidentally the Wikipedia page on [Peer Production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production) is quite useful: 

> [A] way of producing goods and services that relies on self-organizing communities of individuals. In such communities, the labor of a large number of people is coordinated towards a shared outcome.

As we learn about peer production we'll learn to distinguish it from different kinds of online collaborations, such as crowdsourcing, citizen science, question and answer sites, and mere sharing of code. Near synonyms for the way of working taught in this course are: "The open source way", "Open collaboration", "Open mass production".

This is a course is about a sociotechnical phenomenon and it takes a sociotechnical approach. In practice this means that we'll be learning both conceptual insight and practical skills. The course weaves together learning how to use key technologies of collaboration (e.g., git, github, travisCI, markdown) at the same time that we learn social and organizational theory about peer production (e.g., the role copyright licenses, motivations of participants, governance models, coordination theory, models of collaboration risk, cultures of collaboration). 

There are no pre-requistes for this course. While we will be discussing software development students will not be required to program. We will use the command line as we learn to use `git` and `github` everything will be covered in class.

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Conceptually distinguish peer production from other organizational forms or phenomena, such as corporations, crowdsourcing, open access publishing, and communities of practice.
- Reason about how, why, and when peer production works (and when it does not!)
- Engage critically with published research and popular discourse about peer production

Practically students will be able to:

- Install and use `git` to manage versions in their own work
- Participate in `github` hosted peer production (making and receiving pull requests)
- Create and publish documents in `markdown` and `wikitext` format
- Apply a machine-readable Creative Commons license to works
- Ask technical questions that people want to answer
- Participate in a peer production project of their choice

```
There is no final exam for this course. 

Grading will follow Texas Information School recommendations (including A, A-, B+, and so on).

### Participation in class discussion and activities

Students are expected to attend class and to participate in discussion and activities. Students should email the professor prior to class if they cannot make it. Material throughout the course builds on earlier material (both technical and conceptual). If you cannot make class you should refer to the online materials first and then consult with your classmates. Office hours are not for personal replays of teaching, nor can they compensate for not participating in discussion.

### Technical Challenges

The course will have assignments based on the technical topics we are learning, including use of the DataCamp course (see below).

### Peer production adaptation paper

For this assignment students will write a 2,000 word scholarly essay describing and analyzing efforts to adapt peer production outside of software development and wikipedia. Examples could include open hardware, open governance, open culture, and everyone is encouraged to find a project relevant to their own interests. The paper should draw on the conceptual literature to compare and contrast the challenge faced by these adaptation efforts to what we've learned about "the open source way". Students will conduct at least one interview with participants (or former participants if the effort is no longer continuing). The paper will also describe the collaboration infrastructure and compare it to the technologies we have learned in class).

The paper will be authored in Markdown and submitted via a pull request to the class github.

### Peer Production Participation Project

Students will identify and participate in an active peer production community of their choosing. The activity does not have to be software development and does not have to use `git` or `github`. For example, it could be reading and contributing a chapter of a book to [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/) or working with a [WikiProject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject). If you are already involved in a peer production project you may use that, but most will be entering afresh. All components should reference the insight readings that we do througout the course.

There are three graded components, each to be submitted via a pull request.

1. Identifying and describing a peer production community. ~500 words. Authored in plain text or markdown. This paper should clearly identify the community and argue for it being a peer production community. The paper should describe how the student thinks the peer production community works and their expectations about participation.

2. Participating and describing that participation in an experience report of ~500 words, authored in Markdown. Students should describe their experience in the project. At a minimum the paper should desribe the work done, how it was contributed, as well as whether and how the work was reviewed. Students should compare their experience with their expectations described in the first paper. Submit via a pull request from a branch created just for this submission (ie not master). Due Sunday night.

3. Creating and giving a presentation on their participation. Presentations are limited to 5 minutes, this should be approx 4-6 slides long and be authored using Markdown that produces slides. Presentations will occur in our final class meeting. Submit via a pull request from a branch created just for this submission (ie not master). Due at 6pm Monday.

## Materials

There are no required texts for this course and no materials to purchase.

Readings, tutorials, and will be provided via pages linked from the class calendar below.

I have enrolled the class in [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), giving students free access to the DataCamp courses (including their premium courses). In particular we will be using their interactive course on `git` during classes in the first half of the course.  I encourage students to explore their other course options during the semester.

# Course Outline

## Course Schedule

Table below shows classes and topics planned. Each class has both an insight (aka theory, conceptual) and a skills (aka tech, practical) component. These will become links to materials for the class.

  kable("html", escape = FALSE, col.names = NULL) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "striped")) %>% 
  group_rows(index = group_counts)
```

## Insight Readings

Often I can link directly to websites or PDFs, but sometimes I will provide links to articles in journals etc. You must be able to get the article through the library, generally speaking using the [web VPN](http://vpn.utexas.edu) is the most convenient approach. Another option that can sometimes work is [UnPaywall](http://unpaywall.org/) which works to find an open access article version when looking at a publisher's page for the article.

```{r}
insight_dated <- insight_readings %>% left_join(meetings, by = c("topic_assigned" = "insight_topic"))

group_counts <- insight_dated %>% 
  arrange(class_day) %>% 
  group_by(topic_assigned, class_day) %>% 
  summarize(group_size = n()) %>% 
  arrange(class_day) %>% 
  select(-class_day) %>% 
  deframe

# group_indexes <- setNames(group_counts$group_size, group_counts$topic_assigned)

insight_dated %>% 
  mutate(reading_link = glue("[link]({reading_link})")) %>% 
  arrange(class_day) %>% 
  select(reading_text, reading_link) %>% 
  kable("html", escape = FALSE, col.names = NULL) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "striped")) %>% 
  group_rows(index = group_counts)

# Policies

## Academic Integrity

Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: "As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity." Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. In particular, students are reminded that proper citation requires mentioning sources when you use them, not just in a general list of references at the end of a document. You are responsible for understanding UT's Academic Honesty and the	University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php

## Student rights and responsibilities

-	You have a right to a learning environment that supports mental and physical wellness.
-	You have a right to respect.
-	You have a right to be assessed and graded fairly.
-	You have a right to freedom of opinion and expression.
-	You have a right to privacy and confidentiality.
-	You have a right to meaningful and equal participation, and to self-organize groups to improve your learning environment.
-	You have a right to learn in an environment that is welcoming to all people. No student shall be isolated, excluded or diminished in any way.

With these rights come responsibilities:

- You are responsible for taking care of yourself, managing your time, and communicating with the teaching team and with others if things start to feel out of control or overwhelming.
- You are responsible for acting in a way that is worthy of respect and always respectful of others. 
- Your experience with this course is directly related to the quality of the energy that you bring to it, and your energy shapes the quality of your peers' experiences.
- You are responsible for creating an inclusive environment and for speaking up when someone is excluded. In particular, you are responsible for ensuring that your participation does not exclude the participation of others. Office hours are available for in-depth further discussion of advanced topics or other interests that pursuing in depth during class would exclude others.
- You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each other to these standards, and holding the teaching team accountable as well.

## Personal Pronoun Preference

Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.

## Drop Policy

If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you'll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop

International students *must* [meet with the international office](https://world.utexas.edu/isss/visa/maintain/student) before dropping a class that would put them below full-time status. 

## University Resources for Students

Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we'll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources on campus, detailed below.

### Services for Students with Disabilities

This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact
Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone).  http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/

### Counseling and Mental Health Center

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
 
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.  http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html

### The Sanger Learning Center

All students, including graduate students, are welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center's classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit  https://ugs.utexas.edu/slc/grad or call 512-471-3614 (JES A332).
