**Experience report of peer production participation ---- INF 385T Peer Production**

--Minglang Xie

Like I introduced in the participation paper before, Baidupedia is an open source platform and community for all of the users to edit and make changes for a specific topic and key word. I will show how I participated this community and how I use my knowledge to edit some topics and items based on my recent experiences in this paper.

There are several steps to participate in the community. First, I have to find an area or topic that I am most familiar with. If one would like to edit a topic and make it public, one needs to be pretty sure about the accuracy. It should be accurate for everyone else to use it as a reference. And second, I need to find the topic which needs to be revised. Some topics need more information to add to them. This needs a lot of time to find because for a rather mature system like Baidupedia, the information and knowledge is quite enough for topic explanation. And next, try to add contents. I can edit any unprotected page and improve articles immediately for all readers after registration (different from Wikipedia, for stricter regulation). Although there is no central user or editor completely in the center of it, the contents can still not be completely free, there is a system to make sure the contents are legal and relevantly helpful to the topic. If it is legal and helpful, the system will respond to you less than 5 days.

Like the most participants, not like the traditional production requiring certain forms of rewards, generally wages, here we usually participate in peer production voluntarily. Because I am very familiar with the financial knowledge and market research area, I decided to find topics related to these. First is a topic about a test named Certified Public Accountant, it is quite detailed according to Baidupedia but the contents are from official website of CPA which lacks personal experience and special cased when registering for the exam. So as an exam taker, I added something like “For candidates who are studying abroad, if they want to simplify the registration method (because the diploma needs to be certified by the Ministry of Education or provide the proof of the school, this step is more complicated for international students), you can register as a non-graduate and use the certificate of undergraduate graduation. And then use the number of your diploma for registration.” And I also add introduction about Bloomberg software. I compare the prices of different financial tools like Bloomberg.

Before I add those, Baidupedia will ask me whether I want to correct a mistake or I want to make it comprehensive. It also wants to make sure that what I am adding is useful and unique. After I added those contents, Baidupedia will pop up a window to let me select details about the contents and after I click yes, the system will notify me to wait less than 5 days to get feedback. Actually, the system used only 3 hours to respond to my participation and make it public.
